#Initial Value Problem
In mathematics, in the field of differential equations, an initial value problem (also called the Cauchy problem by some authors) is an ordinary differential equation together with a specified value, called the initial condition, of the unknown function at a given point in the domain of the solution. In physics or other sciences, modeling a system frequently amounts to solving an initial value problem; in this context, the differential equation is an evolution equation specifying how, given initial conditions, the system will evolve with time.

#Ordinary Differential Equation
In this code, we are using this ODE:

dy/dt = -20 * y + 7 * Math.exp(-0.5 * t)

##Function:
Solving analytic

y = (7/19.5)*exp(-0.5*t)+4.6410256410256410256410256410256*exp(-20*t)

**Initial Value** = 5.0
